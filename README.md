# Profitability-analysis-for-different-asset-Products
Profitability analysis of various assets Products:- Have developed a "100% stacked bar chart" of their: 1. Total long-term assets and total short-term assets; 2. Total long-term liabilities and total short-term liabilities; 3. Total debt and total equity; and 4. Total capital and total retained earnings. In less than 100 words, I summarized the analysis by mentioning my observations. It is important to note that short-term assets refer to current assets. Similarly, current liabilities are represented by short-term liabilities.
